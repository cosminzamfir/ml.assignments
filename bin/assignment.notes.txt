- run kmeans and em on the 2 data sets
- run pca, ica, rca and another one on the 2 data sets
- rerun the kmeans and em on the 2 data sets with reduced dimensions

For one data set from assignment 1 - it will be the robot-moves:
	- apply the dimensionality reduction algorithms on the data set and rerun the ANN on the newly projected data
	- run the clustering algo on the same data set and treat the clusters as new features. Rerun ANN on the resulting
	data set
	
Implementations details:
	- kmeans and em using weka
	- pca,ica,rca using abagail and export result at text file
	- transform the text file to arff weka format => 8 files in total
	- rerun kmeans and em on the new files =>
